## 📝 Description

This application was designed to counteract a common problem that is faced within companies. This app allows formulated structuring and storage of reviews, recognitions, feedback for employees and allows them to see where they can improve on. It acts as a hub for all the information about their growth and development, and can be used for guidance and personal improvement, allowing them to take their development into their own hands. This also serves as our final project for our 9 week intensive training course delivered by [Lafosse Academy](https://www.lafosseacademy.com/).
